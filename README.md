Web app to make positive impact action to sustainable development

The development of this web app is based on the sustainable development research and feedback of 80 user interviews integrated in
this prototype https://invis.io/9874GSJS6. We have a pitch deck https://goo.gl/yZ1eWT for the social enterprise planned
when the first funding round could be achieved.
This part is the architecture of the web app.
